angular-PubSub
==============

>AngularJS implementation of the [Publishâ€“Subscribe pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern).

##Installation
- Include <code>angular-pubsub.js</code> in your project after <code>angular.js</code>.
- Register to your application:
```js
var app = angular.module('app', ['PubSub']);
```

##Bower Installation
<code>bower install angular.pubsub</code>

##Using PubSub

### Inject as dependency
Inject the service as a dependency of the application modules, to use it:
```js
var MyController = app.controller('MyController', ['PubSub', function (PubSub) {
	// do your stuff here...
}]);
```

###Subscribing events
The "listener" is the function to be executed when an event is emitted.
```js
function listener(topic, data) {
    console.log('An event is published.');
    console.log(topic);
    console.log(data);
}

// Subscribe to event
var sub = PubSub.subscribe('event-name', listener);

// Subscribe to event and execute only one time
var subOnce = PubSub.subscribeOnce('event-name', listener)
```

###Publishing events
The <code>publish</code> method takes two arguments:

- The first one is the name of the event.
- The second one (optional) is the data we may want to pass along as. We can pass data along using an array or an object as shown below.
```js
PubSub.publish('event-name', {
    prop1: value1,
    prop2: value2
});
```

###Unsubscribing events
There are two ways to unsubscribe an event:

- Unsubscribe from a specific topic based on a tokenized reference to the subscription.
```js
PubSub.unsubscribe(sub);
```
- Unsubscribe from a specific topic based on topic name. This way we can unsubscribe all events with the same name.
```js
PubSub.unsubscribe('event-name');
```

##Methods aliases
- <code>on</code> - <code>subscribe</code>
- <code>once</code> - <code>subscribeOnce</code>
- <code>trigger</code> - <code>publish</code>
- <code>off</code> - <code>unsubscribe</code>

##Minify
To minify the project, run <code>grunt build</code> command. This will run the removelogging and uglify the code into <code>dist/angular-pubsub.min.js</code>.
